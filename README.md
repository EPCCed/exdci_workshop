## Summary

Funded by EXDCI-2, EPCC is organising a 2-day workshop in Edinburgh on 8-9 July 2019 to present ideas on how science and engineering can be supported from Raspberry Pis to large scale supercomputers. We are looking to investigate how to introduce these topics to school-age audiences including linking to existing school curricula. This will include examples of existing education materials and activities and looking ahead to current plans.

We are interested in a wide range of areas including encouraging school children to learn to program, showing the benefits of computer simulations, what can be learned from big data and how data is collected and used online.

The aim of the workshop is to promote discussion between school teachers and those developing computer-based activities and demonstrators. After the workshop we will write a report covering the outcomes.

We are keen to have participants from across the range of education including teachers involved in scientific subjects and primary education, and computational and data scientists with an interest in supporting school development. This workshop is intended to benefit participants from the UK and the EU.

We have a limited level of funding to support travel and accommodation costs for attendees from the UK and EU, and you will be able to submit an application for this as part of the Registration form.
